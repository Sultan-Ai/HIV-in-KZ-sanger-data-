# HIV-in-KZ-sanger-data-
I analyzed Sanger sequences of HIV infected patients in Kazakhstan. The data was collected from the Republican Center for the Prevention and Control of AIDS. The samples were collected between 2017-2020. The notebook achieves the task of aligning sequences with subtype A6 along with mapping number of patients in each region of Kazakhstan. This information is useful to derive further actionable recommendations for health officials. This work showcased common work that I did in bioscience. This notebook uses a local MUSCLE program. It can be downloaded from https://github.com/rcedgar/muscle/releases/tag/5.1.0.
